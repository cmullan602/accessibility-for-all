# Refactor Semantics and Accessibility Project

## Description 

- I built this project to refractor Horiseons Social Media Marketing website and add accesibility features to make it more user friendly.

- I was motivated for this project by semantic HTML code and accesibility features that should be included on all websites. 

- The project contains an index.html file that is linked to a style.css file as well as several image files.

- Throughout this project I learned the importance of semantic HTML in terms of accesibility. I also learned how to be more efficient when writing code.
