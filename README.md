# Refactor Semantics and Accessibility Project
This is a Social Media Marketing Website for Horiseon. 
The project contains an index.html file that is linked to a style.css file. 
I worked on the project for my Week 1 Coding Bootcamp Challenge. 
The website has a header with three working hyper links that take you to three seperate sections within the website that cover Service Engine Optimization, Online reputation managment and Social Media Marketing. 
The website has an aside that covers lead generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management. 
The website ends with a footer that lists who the website was made by and a copyright mark.
